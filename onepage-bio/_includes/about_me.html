                    I'm currently a Graduate student at the University of Illinois as Chicago, where I'm studying Management Information Systems. I have an undergraduate degree in Information Decision Science concentrating in Management Information Systems and a minor in Managerial Studies.

                    While working for Advanced Technology Services, I worked at a startup department called Hardware Solutions. I started out by being their marketing intern, within a week I was promoted to become a network consulting intern. I reached out to clients to see what kind of solutions we could find for their need. After working in this position, I was switched to a more leadership role where I oversaw the daily operations of client outreach, client consulting, application development along with being tasked with creating new business partnerships with leaders in the market such as Cisco, HPE, Nokia, Aerohive.
